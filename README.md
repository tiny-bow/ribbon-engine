This is the main repo for the Ribbon realtime software engine.

The [Ribbon Programming Language](https://github.com/tiny-bow/ribbon-language) is still a work in progress, so this repo currently just serves as a sandbox for testing and brainstorming.

For now, issues are turned off and pull requests without [prior discussion](https://tinybow.org) are discouraged.
